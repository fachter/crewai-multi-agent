Would any time on Thursday this week (6th June) suit you as well? This would simplify our meeting and make it more convenient for my visit.\\n\\nIf that doesn't work out, we can schedule an alternative: Tuesday, 11th June at 10:30 am remains a viable option.\\n\\nThank you in advance, and I'm looking forward to meeting you soon.\\n\\nBest,\\nFelix.\\n\\nNote: I kept the original tone of the email friendly but professional, while improving grammar, sentence structures, and wording (by replacing some words with synonyms) without changing the content. I also checked for any grammar or spelling mistakes before providing the improved version as the final answer.\""
